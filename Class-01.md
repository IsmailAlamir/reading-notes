#### What is “props” short for?
Props is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

#### How are props used in React?
1. Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
2. Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
3. Finally, render the Props Data

#### What is the flow of props?
data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child).
Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.
