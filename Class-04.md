#### What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
Controlled Components are those in which form's data is handled by the component's state

#### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
You should update the state with the user's responses as soon as they enter them, controlled component, and as soon as the user enters their response, the component will update the state.

#### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
Using event properties to target the input field.


#### Why would we use a ternary operator?
to simplify if else statements

#### Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

sol:
 x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
