## Definition 
**Component-based architecture** is a design approach that involves dividing a system into smaller, independent components with well-defined interfaces.
## Purpose 
The primary goal of component-based architecture is to promote component reuse, which can reduce development time and cost, increase reliability, and enable greater flexibility in system design.
## Components
**Components** are modular units of software that encapsulate specific functionality and have an explicitly defined interface. They can be viewed in terms of their object-oriented, conventional, or process-related characteristics, and they can be used in different types of applications.
## Characteristics
Components have certain characteristics such as reusability, replaceability, extensibility, and encapsulation.
## Benefits
The benefits of component-based architecture include reduced development time and cost, increased reliability, and greater flexibility in system design.

In summary, component-based architecture is a design approach that involves dividing a system into smaller, independent components with well-defined interfaces. The primary goal of this approach is to promote component reuse and enable the creation of systems by combining existing components rather than building everything from scratch. This approach has several benefits, including reduced development time and cost, increased reliability, and greater flexibility in system design.
