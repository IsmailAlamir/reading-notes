## Cryptography

### Encryption

**Encryption** is a process where information is converted to something else to hide it from strangers.

An example on encryption is the **Caesar Cipher**, which was made by Julius Caesar more than two thousand years ago.

This cipher used the idea of shifting each letter in the text by a certain amount.

example:
    
    Message: 
    Shift/Key (number): 3
    I LOVE CODING

    Ciphertext:
    F ILSB ZLAFKD

### Decryption

**Decryption** is a process where encrypted information is converted to plain text.

### Ways of cracking codes:

- **Frequency analysis**: is a process where we analyze the frequency of the characters in the message and identify the most likely chracters and narrow it down.
- **Brute force**: is a process where we keep trying over and over until you brack it down.
