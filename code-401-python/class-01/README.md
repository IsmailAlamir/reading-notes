# Big O Notation

Big O Notation is used to measure or describe the performance of any algorithm by providing the order of growth of the function.

- O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
- O(n) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
- O(n²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
- O(2^n) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.

|    Notation   | Name | Example |
| :---:        |    :----:   |          :---: |
| O(1)      | constant	       | A function that only returns a value(without loops).   |
| O(n)      | linear	       |  A function that includes one loop. |
| O(n²)   | quadratic	        | A function that includes nested loops.      |
| O(2^n)   | exponential        |  A recursion function.      |
