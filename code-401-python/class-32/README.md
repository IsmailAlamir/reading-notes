# Intro to Next.js & Tailwind CSS

## WHAT IS NEXT.JS?

**Next.js** is a JavaScript framework for building server-rendered or statically exported React applications. It provides a simple way to get started with React and includes a wide range of features that help you build high-performance and scalable applications.

With **Next.js**, you can build web applications that are optimized for server-side rendering (SSR), static exporting, and client-side rendering. This makes it easy to create applications that are SEO-friendly, fast, and easy to develop.

Some of the key features of **Next.js** include:

- Automatic code splitting: **Next.js** automatically splits your code into small chunks that are loaded on demand, helping to reduce the overall size of your application and improve performance.

- Server-side rendering: **Next.js** pre-renders your React components on the server, so that your application can be rendered immediately when a user requests it. This can improve performance and make your application more SEO-friendly.

- Static exporting: **Next.js** can generate a static version of your application that can be deployed to a CDN or other static hosting service. This allows you to create fast and scalable applications that can be served directly from a CDN.

- File-system routing: **Next.js** uses the file system as the source of truth for routing, making it easy to define routes and manage your application's structure.

- Built-in CSS support: **Next.js** includes built-in support for CSS and Sass, so you can easily style your application without having to set up a separate build step.

## Tailwind CSS

**Tailwind CSS** is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It provides a wide range of low-level utility classes that you can use to style your HTML elements directly, without having to write custom CSS.

One of the key benefits of using Tailwind CSS is that it helps you build custom designs faster by providing a large set of pre-defined styles that you can use as-is or customize as needed. Instead of having to write your own CSS from scratch, you can use the classes provided by Tailwind CSS to quickly style your elements and build custom layouts.

Tailwind CSS is designed to be highly customizable, so you can fine-tune the look and feel of your application to match your specific design needs. It also includes a set of pre-defined color palettes and font sizes that you can use as a starting point, and you can easily create your own custom styles by extending the framework.

Overall, Tailwind CSS is a popular choice for developers who want a flexible and efficient way to style their applications without having to write a lot of custom CSS. It can be used with any modern front-end framework, including React, Vue.js, and Angular.
