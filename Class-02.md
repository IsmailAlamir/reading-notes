I think that understanding the syntax and life-cycle of React will help me organize my thinking when programming, and this leads to an understanding of the entire syntax.
and knowing the difference between probs and Stete also helps me to use them in the best way possible

#### Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
render

#### What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
constructor

#### Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates
1- constructor 
2- render
3- React Updates
4- componentDidMount
5- componentWillUnmount

#### What does componentDidMount do?
 allows to execute the React code when the component is already placed in the DOM

#### What types of things can you pass in the props?
you can pass any data type

#### What is the big difference between props and state?
Props used to pass data from component to another (father to child), and its constant -can not be change- .
State represents parts of an application that can change.

#### When do we re-render our application?
if there is any change in a props or state.

#### What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
- string 
- number
